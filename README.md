# scRNA-seq Imputation and Cell Type Clustering Pipeline

A two-stage pipeline for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis that combines dropout imputation and prior-knowledge-guided cell type identification into a single run.

### Stage 1 — Imputation

scRNA-seq data often contains zero expression values that are not truly zero, but result from technical limitations during sequencing — known as **dropout events**. This stage identifies likely dropout positions and replaces them with estimated values by:

1. Computing a weighted cell–cell correlation matrix
2. Reducing dimensions via truncated SVD
3. Running an ensemble of K-means clustering to build a consensus matrix
4. Detecting likely dropout positions based on the consensus
5. Imputing dropout values using a weighted average of similar cells

This step relies purely on the structure of the data itself — no external biological information is used yet. Its goal is simply to recover expression signal that dropout noise would otherwise hide from the clustering stage that follows.

### Stage 2 — Pathway-Guided Clustering

Using the imputed expression matrix from Stage 1, this stage identifies biologically meaningful cell type groups. Unlike conventional clustering that selects genes based on statistical criteria alone (e.g. variance or mean expression), this stage incorporates **prior biological knowledge in the form of curated pathway gene sets** to guide which genes are allowed to drive the clustering result. The reasoning is that genes belonging to known biological pathways are more likely to carry real cell-type-defining signal than genes selected by statistical variance alone, which can be inflated by technical noise.

The stage works as follows:

1. **Pathway-informed gene filtering** — genes are first restricted to those annotated within curated biological pathways, then further filtered by expression and variance criteria. This step is what distinguishes the method from purely data-driven clustering: pathway membership acts as a biological prior that constrains feature selection toward genes with known functional relevance, rather than relying on statistical signal alone.
2. Building an ensemble of KNN graphs using UMAP and PCA dimensionality reductions on the pathway-filtered gene sets
3. Aggregating graphs into a consensus network
4. Applying Louvain community detection to partition cells into clusters
5. Merging over-partitioned clusters using t-test-based separation scores on top marker genes

By anchoring feature selection to biological pathways rather than statistics alone, this stage aims to produce clusters that are not just statistically separable, but also more interpretable and biologically grounded.

pip install numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn joblib anndata umap-learn igraph networkx python-louvain seaborn matplotlib
```

## Input Files

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `dataset.csv` | Normalized gene expression matrix (genes × cells). Can be any normalized scRNA-seq dataset — rows are genes, columns are cells. |
| `dataset_label.csv` | Cell type labels for evaluation (optional, used for ARI/NMI/Purity metrics) |
| `exported_pathways.csv` | Biological pathway gene sets — rows are pathway names, columns are member genes. This file is the source of prior biological knowledge used in Stage 2. |

> The pipeline accepts any normalized scRNA-seq dataset. Simply update the file paths in **Section 1** of `main_pipeline.py` to point to your own data.

## Usage

**1. Update the input file paths in Section 1 of `main_pipeline.py`:**

```python
logX = pd.read_csv("your_expression_data.csv", index_col=0, engine="python")
data_label  = pd.read_csv("your_labels.csv", index_col=0)
pathways_df = pd.read_csv("exported_pathways.csv", index_col=0, low_memory=False, dtype=object)
```

**2. Run the pipeline:**

```bash
python main_pipeline.py
```

**3. Output:**

- `dataset_imputed.csv` — imputed expression matrix saved after Stage 1
- Cluster assignments and evaluation metrics (ARI, NMI, Purity) printed to console
